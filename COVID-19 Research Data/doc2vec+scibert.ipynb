Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broadspectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.\n",

However, no Food and Drug Administrationapproved Ebola drugs or vaccines are available yet with the mainstay of therapy being supportive care. The high fatality rate and absence of effective treatment or vaccination make Ebola virus a category-A biothreat pathogen. Fortunately, a series of investigational countermeasures have been developed to control and prevent this global threat. This review summarizes the recent therapeutic advances and ongoing research progress from research and development to clinical trials in the development of small-molecule antiviral drugs, small-interference RNA molecules, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, fulllength monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. Moreover, difficulties are highlighted in the search for effective countermeasures against EVD with additional focus on the interplay between available in silico prediction methods and their evidenced potential in antiviral drug discovery.\n",

Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/).

antigenicity, subsequent (A) The core molecule, linear poly(ethylene) glycol, a diol, with two free hydroxyl groups; (B) Monomethoxy poly(ethylene) glycol (mPEG)', ' The single hydroxyl group is the

activated with either succinimidyl carbonate or benzotriazole are linked to the \\uf0b5and \\uf065-amino groups of lysine', ' These molecules offer the advantage of adding two PEG molecules at each attachment site, affording broader protection from proteolysis and the immune response without reducing bioactivity; (D) Multi-arm PEG', ' These compounds, generally prepared with hexaglycerine at the core, offer multiple hydroxyl groups for attachment of many copies of the same or several different reactive groups for protein and peptide conjugation; (E) Forked shaped PEG', ' Fork-shaped PEGs provide multiple reactive groups in close proximity at one or both ends (Panel F) of the PEG chain, where X represents functional groups', ' Early on, lysine, one of the most plentiful amino acids present in many proteins, was identified as the primary site for attachment of PEG residues and could be modified with a wide selection of chemical moieties (Figure 3 ) [10] , commonly used for PEGylation of both free \\uf0b5and \\uf065-amino groups on peptides and proteins', ' Protocols employing these molecules are often plagued with the presence of impurities and non-specific attachment to residues, allowing for inconsistencies between production lots', ' These chemistries are also restricted to low molecular weight polymers', ' Once attached to a bioactive molecule, they are relatively unstable and tend to degrade soon after administration in vivo', ' These PEG derivatives have been developed for specific attachment to cysteine residues on proteins and peptides', ' (A) PEG-maleimide is able to conjugate to free thiols under acidic (pH 6-7) conditions, however, this compound is not stable in water and the ring is susceptible to opening or addition of water across the

except in a reducing environment when the linkage is converted to a thiol', ' (C) PEG-iodoacetamide, reacts slowly with thiol residues to form stable thioether bonds in mildly basic media', ' Use of this compound is advantageous in the context that, by strong acid hydrolysis, modification of a protein with this compound gives rise to a stable cysteine conjugate, carboxymethylcysteine that can be identified and quantified by standard amino acid sequencing techniques to verify the degree of modification of the parent protein', ' It is also important to note that any reaction employing this polymer should be performed under dark conditions in order to prevent the production of free iodine that may react with other amino acids such as tyrosine', ' (D) PEG-vinyl sulfone reacts slowly with thiols to form a stable thioester linkage to proteins under slightly basic conditions (pH [7] [8] ', ' This process will proceed at a faster rate if the pH is increased', ' However, under these conditions, PEGvinyl sulfone may also react with free lysines', ' Use of any of these compounds is dictated by protein solubility/stability under reaction conditions defined by the PEGylation chemistry, availability/accessibility of cysteine residues on the protein surface, desired speed of reaction and availability of methodology for characterization of protein conjugates', 'Today, PEGylation processes focus on select amino acids, such as thiol groups on cysteine residues, as primary sites for attachment, thereby minimizing random attachment of PEG to the protein surface and the amount of heterogeneous conjugates in a given preparation [12] ', ' Improved site-specific PEGylation with these reagents minimizes loss of biological activity through enhanced preservation of the native protein structure', ' Complex, branched second generation PEG molecules have also been shown to maintain pH and thermal stability, reduce immunogenicity and protect modified proteins from proteolysis to a much higher degree than those modified with first generation chemistries [4, 5] ', ' Further refinement of these molecules led to the development of heterofunctional PEGs that directly link the protein of interest to another molecule used for targeting specific cells and tissues', ' A general schematic of PEGylation strategies is summarized in Figure 5 ', ' Figure 5 ', ' The Building Blocks of a PEGylated Therapeutic', ' Once a therapeutic molecule amenable to PEGylation is identified, the appropriate PEG chemistry must be selected', ' Properties such as size, symmetry, and bifunctionality must be considered and adopted according to the desired application', ' The linker used for covalent attachment of PEG must also be evaluated with respect to the strength of the bond created as well as its affinity for certain residues on the bioactive molecule', ' Receptor-specific peptides, proteins and molecular sensors have been tethered to PEGylated therapeutics for cellular and tissue specific targeting', 'Davis and Abuchowski were the first to modify two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and liver catalase, with methoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEG) of 1,900 and 5,000 Daltons (Da) using cyanuric chloride and 2,4,6-trichloro-8-triazine as the coupling agents, respectively [13, 14] ', ' One of their prime findings, that when PEG is properly coupled to a protein or an enzyme, the modified product loses its immunogenicity in vivo, laid the groundwork for additional studies that suggested that protein antigens modified by this technique may not only fail to induce an immune response but may be tolerogenic', ' This phenomenon was first reported by Lee et al', ' when intravenous administration of PEGylated ovalbumin (PEG-OVA) 4 hours before sensitizing with dinitrophenylated OVA (DNP-OVA) suppressed the primary anti-DNP-OVA and anti-OVA IgE responses in both mice and rats', ' These animals also responded very poorly to additional doses of DNP-OVA', ' In contrast, injection of unmodified OVA did not alter the ability of the animals to mount IgE responses to DNP-OVA [15] ', ' Additional reports have been written summarizing similar transitions for other allergens including ragweed pollen extract, uricase, L-asparaginase, hen egg lysozyme, and bovine gamma globulin and other antibodies to non-immunogenic, tolerogenic derivatives through PEGylation [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ', 'Although it has been shown that repeat administration of each of these PEGylated allergens significantly reduces IgM, IgG and IgE antibody levels against the native antigen, it has also been found that the degree of suppression depends on the immunological state at the time of treatment, the nature of allergen and the dose', ' Suppression of the antibody-mediated response was best observed in mice without measurable anti-allergen antibodies, while the weakest suppression was observed in mice with high levels of antibodies at the time of treatment [26] ', ' Additional studies have found that PEGylated allergens can induce a long-term suppression of the antibody response [15, 18, 21, 26, 27] ', ' For example, administration of PEGylated human monoclonal immunoglobulins (HIgG) suppressed the anti-HIgG antibody response by more than 95% for over 300 days after a series of seven injections of the immunizing antigen in mice [21] ', ' While the exact mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs remains unknown, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from animals given several doses of PEGylated compounds to naïve animals suggests that PEG-modified allergens activate antigen-specific CD8 + suppressor T cells [15, 18, 27, 28] ', ' Since proliferation of suppressor T cells and the associated production of factors that dampen the immune response is dependent upon the concentration of circulating antigen during the tolerization process, slowing of antigen processing and extending the half-life of the antigen by PEGylation most likely plays a major role in the immunosuppressive capacity of the conjugates [17,24,25]', 'As data continued to suggest that PEGylated biomolecules were less immunogenic than their native counterparts, many interested in preventing immunorejection during transplantation began to apply this process to intact, viable cells and tissues', ' Modification of type A and type B human red blood cells (RBCs) with mPEG did not compromise the structure, function and viability of the cell and prevented agglutination by anti-A and anti-B antisera, respectively [29-31]', ' PEGylation of ovine RBCs prolonged their survival when transfused into mice [30] ', ' PEGylation of lymphocytes can inhibit MHC class II activation and proliferation of T cells, as was demonstrated in an in vivo

time from 7 to 10 days [34]', ' PEGylation reduced proliferation in the donor T cell population, suggesting that the loss of T cell responsiveness is likely due to disruption interactions between the T cells and antigen presenting cells necessary to mount an immune response [32] ', ' It has also been suggested that this weak, ineffective co-stimulation of alloreactive T cells induces apoptosis, leading to tolerance of donor tissue [34] ', ' This phenomenon has been further exemplified in diabetic rat models where PEGylation improved pancreatic islet viability, facilitated engraftment and re-established blood glucose homeostasis [34, 35] ', ' Additional studies demonstrated that PEGylation efficiently blocked recognition of the transplants by immune cells, allowing them to remain stably functional in diabetic recipients for several weeks [35-38]', 'Approval of Adagen\\uf0d2 (Pegademase) for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) by the U', 'S', ' FDA

milliliter of red blood cells alone [40] , marked notable progress in the area of enzyme replacement therapy by minimizing the number of doses needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, eliminating the need for blood transfusion and avoiding the risk of iron overload and transfusion-associated viral infection [11] ', ' In a similar manner, therapeutic use of L-asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was hindered by the fact that frequent intramuscular injections, necessary for therapeutic efficacy, also induced strong hypersensitivity reactions, rendering the enzyme ineffective in many patients [41] ', ' Covalent attachment of 5 kDa PEG to this enzyme four years later reduced its immunogenicity and the necessity for frequent dosing, allowing for successful use in those with

transfer and the transgene product', ' Rapid clearance from the circulation by the complement system and the immunogenicity associated with non-viral and viral vectors alike were the primary reasons for applying PEGylation technology to gene delivery vectors', ' In this regard, PEGylation was initially used for non-viral vectors and eventually for viral vectors as the immune response became the most significant limitation to therapeutic gene transfer', ' Additional efforts soon recognized that advanced PEG chemistries accommodated attachment of specific ligands to the vectors, making them less promiscuous and promoting tissue and cell-specific gene expression', 'Non-viral gene transfer is a method by which DNA is formulated with cationic lipids and/or polymers to create dense particles
