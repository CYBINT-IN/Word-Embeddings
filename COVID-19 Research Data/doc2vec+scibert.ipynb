Aged BALB/c mice displayed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV and have been a valuable platform for evaluation of strategies against SARS-CoV infection. In this study, we confirmed the validity of this model using various methods, and verified that equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab') 2 can prevent aged animals from SARS-CoV infection. In a therapeutic setting, treatment with anti-SARS-CoV F(ab') 2 decreased viral load more than several thousand folds in the lungs. Thus, this antibody should be a potential candidate for treatment of elderly patients suffering from SARS.\n",

The high fatality rate and absence of effective treatment or vaccination make Ebola virus a category-A biothreat pathogen. Fortunately, a series of investigational countermeasures have been developed to control and prevent this global threat. This review summarizes the recent therapeutic advances and ongoing research progress from research and development to clinical trials in the development of small-molecule antiviral drugs, small-interference RNA molecules, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, fulllength monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. Moreover, difficulties are highlighted in the search for effective countermeasures against EVD with additional focus on the interplay between available in silico prediction methods and their evidenced potential in antiviral drug discovery.\n",

However, its mysterious animal origins [3] and strong infectivity necessitates further studies on how to control its replication in affected individuals', ' Retrospective studies have shown that elderly patients with SARS experienced high mortality and morbidity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , suggesting that susceptibility to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could be correlated with aging', ' Based upon this observation, Roberts and colleagues established an aged mouse model that has a longer course of virus replication and more severe pathological changes in the respiratory tract than what is observed in young mice [10] , which indicates that it is an appropriate animal model paralleling aged humans, in terms of susceptibility to SARS-CoV', 'Adoptive antibody transfer has been used

control various virus infections, such as rabies [14] , HBV [15, 16] , and HIV [17, 18] ', \" Based on these evidence of the feasibility that equine antibody can be used for human diseases, we have developed an equine anti-SARS-CoV F(ab') 2 that can provide excellent protection from this virus infection, that we previously have tested in a BALB/c model [19] \", 'However, vigorous tests in animal models must be conducted before further clinical trials to insure its efficacy', ' In this study, we confirmed the aged mouse model using additional assessing methods than previously reported [10] , and then tested the equine anti-SARS-CoV antibody in this model, in both preventive and therapeutic settings', ' As expected, the antibody exhibited a complete preventive effect and a considerable therapeutic role against SARS-CoV infection in this animal model, providing strong evidence for potential application for this antibody in future clinical test', 'SARS-CoV (strains BJ-01 Genbank

      "Text: ['The family Filoviridae includes two accepted genera, Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus', ' The genus Ebolavirus includes five species (each represented by a single virus): Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus, EBOV), Sudan ebolavirus (Sudan virus, SUDV), Reston ebolavirus (Reston virus, RESTV), Taï Forest ebolavirus (Tai Forest virus, TAFV), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bundibugyo virus, BDBV)', ' The genus Marburgvirus includes a single species, Marburg marburgvirus, which has two members: Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) [1, 2] ', ' In 1967, the first cases of filoviral infection were documented in three simultaneous outbreaks in West Germany and Yugoslavia', ' The virus responsible for the outbreaks was named \"Marburg virus\" after the German city of Marburg in which it was first recognized [3, 4] ', ' From documented instances of infection, it seems that the members of the filovirus genera may exist in quite opposite climates of Africa with marburgvirus infections occurring more frequently in the dry woodlands, while ebolavirus infections occur more frequently in rain forests [5] ', ' More than 40 years of effort have focused on the search for the reservoir of these viruses in Africa, and while the search is still ongoing, recent evidence indicates that bats may be reservoirs for both marburgviruses and ebolaviruses [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ', ' However, the recent outbreak of RESTV in domestic pigs in the Philippines demonstrated the potential for animals other than primates and bats to be infected and potentially spread or amplify outbreaks [12] ', 'Filoviruses are named for their long, filamentous shape which can been seen on the order of micrometers in length, while their width is more narrow (usually around 80 nm) with little fluctuation [13] ', ' Contained within this filamentous virus is a single, 19-kb negative-sense RNA genome that encodes seven proteins [14, 15] ', ' The seven filoviral proteins are the glycoprotein (GP), the polymerase (L), the nucleoprotein (NP), a secondary matrix protein (VP24), the transcriptional activator (VP30), the polymerase cofactor (VP35), and the matrix protein (VP40) [16, 17] ', ' Homotrimers of the viral GP cover the surface of the virion, and this viral GP is believed to be the sole host attachment factor for filoviruses [6, 18] ', ' Candidates for filoviral receptor and co-factors include transferrin, DC-SIGN, TIM-1, and NPC1 [16, [19] [20] [21] [22] ', ' After entry, filoviruses replicate their genomes and viral proteins in the cytoplasm using a RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase which is carried in with the virus', 'Wild-type filovirus infection has been associated with severe case fatality rates in humans, as high as 90% [15] ', ' In humans, filovirus infection is characterized by an abrupt onset of flu-like illness, after an initial incubation period of 2-21 days', ' Following this initial illness, signs and symptoms of disease include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, cough, edema, postural hypotension, neurologic complications, petechiae, and mucosal hemorrhage', ' There have also been several observed wild-type filovirus outbreaks among great apes in Africa that have demonstrated similarly high mortality rates [23] ', ' In an effort to create cost and time-effective models of filoviral disease for the development of vaccines and therapeutics, small animals, such as mice and guinea pigs, are often used', ' However, these animals usually demonstrate significant resistance to wild-type filovirus infection, and only demonstrate mortality rates similar to primates when the filovirus in question has been adapted to the model species [24] ', ' Due to the difficulties in evaluating wild-type filovirus infection in small animals and the generally high level of immune protection correlates derived from non-human primate (NHP) models of infection, therapeutics and vaccines are ultimately evaluated in NHP species for efficacy against filovirus', ' Of the NHP models available for filovirus study, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been the most highly characterized and utilized for therapeutic and vaccine development, respectively', ' However, the starting point of vaccine and therapeutic development remains small animal models due to the cost, ethical, and time-associated benefits [17] ', ' This review will highlight the current research into filovirus vaccines and therapeutics', 'The current clinical standard for filoviral infection is supportive care as there are currently no FDA-approved treatment strategies', ' Supportive care consists of oral fluid rehydration, oral medication, nutritional supplementation, and psychosocial support [25] ', ' Nasogastric feeding tubes and i', 'v', ' administration of both fluids and medication are increasingly considered supportive care where possible during outbreak scenarios to prevent dehydration and facilitate support of blood pressure [25, 26] ', ' However, given the limited equipment and laboratory support during outbreaks, care must be taken to prevent overaggressive fluid administration [27] ', ' Fluid replacement was evaluated briefly in rhesus macaques, and while there was no significant benefit to survival, a less severe renal compromise was observed [28] ', ' While supportive care may (or may not) reduce the overall case fatality rate in humans, the true impact of simple interventions such as fluid management has yet to be fully evaluated and the potential for benefit in combination with direct antiviral measures has yet to be assessed [29] ', 'Treatment of filovirus infection with passive transfer of antibodies is an attractive therapy', ' While there have been conflicting results in vitro, in animals, and in humans, recent breakthroughs have solidified the potential for this strategy of intervention', ' In addition, there have been a number of immunotherapies developed for other agents, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which can provide potential roadmaps or precedence to facilitate the advancement of these products through the necessary regulatory hurdles [30, 31] ', ' Transfer of immune serum for the treatment of filovirus infection in humans has previously been attempted', ' However, interpretation of these results has been cautious due to the study conditions as well as the uncertainty of the disease stage at which the individuals were treated [6] ', ' As a result, much attention has focused on animal studies evaluating candidate products', ' While many of the early studies in mice and guinea pigs were successful, these successes did not translate to NHP studies and tempered the enthusiasm for further evaluation of candidate products', ' [6, [32] [33] [34] [35] ', ' When similar passive transfer strategies were attempted in NHPs, viremia onset and outward signs of disease were reduced, but the treatment did not affect survivorship [36] [37] [38] ', ' In addition, the suggestion that antibodies could enhance filovirus infections in vitro caused further concern [39] [40] [41] ', 'However, recently a series of experiments have made researchers, developers, and funding agencies reconsider the potential of this category of products for filoviruses', ' Both polyclonal and monoclonal passive therapies have been shown to be efficacious in rodents for filovirus infection [42] [43] [44] ', ' Furthermore, evidence of enhancing antibodies exists in the antibody response to EBOV [38] ', ' More recent studies have demonstrated protection in macaques with polyclonal and monoclonal passive therapy [45] [46] [47] ', ' These sources of monoclonal antibodies have ranged from murine monoclonal antibodies to recombinant-derived cloned human monoclonal antibodies from survivors of filovirus infection [37, 43] ', 'Development of new antibodies to be used for post-exposure treatment is on-going', ' In one study, an antibody (13F6) targeting the EBOV GP mucin-like domain was generated and subsequently shown to protect 100% of mice against a lethal EBOV challenge when given 2 days post-exposure [44] ', ' This antibody was then modified to generate h-13F6, a human recombinant antibody', ' This human recombinant antibody also significantly protected mice against a lethal challenge of EBOV [48] ', ' In another method, a recombinant VSVΔG/EBOVGP was used to generate a total of 8 monoclonal antibodies which were subsequently characterized', ' All 8 monoclonal antibodies improved survival rate of mice (33%-100%) against a high-dose lethal challenge by mouse-adapted EBOV [49] ', ' Another antibody, KZ52, was isolated from the bone marrow of a human survivor of EBOV infection and is specific for the complex of GP1and GP2 [50] ', ' KZ52 neutralized EBOV in vitro and offered protection from lethal EBOV challenge in a rodent model [43] , but was non-protective in NHPs [37] ', ' Table 1 3', '1', '1', ' DNA VaccinesThe first clinical trials involving filovirus vaccines were based off of plasmids expressing EBOV NP and GP as well as SUDV GP [51] ', ' This strategy proved safe in 27 subjects involved with phase I testing', ' However, the prime/boost DNA vaccine strategy covering four separate plasmid doses administered three times each was ineffective at creating durable immunity as evidenced by the near non-existent antibody titer in these subjects after 1 year [51] ', ' While clinical trials with this vaccine have halted, it may be possible that this strategy can supplement another vaccine technology in a prime/boost capacity', ' While no vaccines or therapeutics are currently licensed for use by the FDA, phase I clinical trial safety tests have been performed on one particular platform for an EBOV vaccine', ' This vaccine is based on a replication deficient, recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd5) vector genetically engineered to carry the genes for EBOV glycoprotein (GP (Z)) and SUDV glycoprotein (GP (S/G))', ' As a common human pathogen, this vector vaccine utilized the broad-tropism of the adenovirus vector to infect cells and once inside the inserted ebolavirus glycoproteins are expressed', ' Upon expression of these inserted ebolavirus genes, the host immune system will recognize them as foreign and mount a response against them', ' The advancement of this vaccine

of GP 1,2 in viral entry, numerous approaches targeting the entry process have been explored to block EBOV replication at an early stage, namely immune-based therapies, [67] [68] [69] [70]

essential to regulate the formation of the EBOV replication complex for efficient transcription/replication', ' Blocking this nucleocapsid formation by proteinprotein interaction inhibitors can lead to potential inhibition of EBOV', ' for example, VP35-derived peptide (first identified NP ligand) that specifically binds to NP, blocks NP oligomerization and causes the release of RNA from NP-RNA
