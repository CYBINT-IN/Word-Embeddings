Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broadspectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.\n",

      " Abstract extract: The causative agent of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was identified as a coronavirus (CoV) following the outbreak of 2002-2003. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n",

for cellular and tissue specific targeting', 'Davis and Abuchowski were the first to modify two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and liver catalase, with methoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEG) of 1,900 and 5,000 Daltons (Da) using cyanuric chloride and 2,4,6-trichloro-8-triazine as the coupling agents, respectively [13, 14] ', ' One of their prime findings, that when PEG is properly coupled to a protein or an enzyme, the modified product loses its immunogenicity in vivo, laid the groundwork for additional studies that suggested that protein antigens modified by this technique may not only fail to induce an immune response but may be tolerogenic', ' This phenomenon was first reported by Lee et al', ' when intravenous administration of PEGylated ovalbumin (PEG-OVA) 4 hours before sensitizing with dinitrophenylated OVA (DNP-OVA) suppressed the primary anti-DNP-OVA and anti-OVA IgE responses in both mice and rats', ' These animals also responded very poorly to additional doses of DNP-OVA', ' In contrast, injection of unmodified OVA did not alter the ability of the animals to mount IgE responses to DNP-OVA [15] ', ' Additional reports have been written summarizing similar

IgE antibody levels against the native antigen, it has also been found that the degree of suppression depends on the immunological state at the time of treatment, the nature of allergen and the dose', ' Suppression of the antibody-mediated response was best observed in mice without measurable anti-allergen antibodies, while the weakest suppression was observed in mice with high levels of antibodies at the time of treatment [26] ', ' Additional studies have found that PEGylated allergens can induce a long-term suppression of the antibody response [15, 18, 21, 26, 27] ', ' For example, administration of PEGylated human monoclonal immunoglobulins (HIgG) suppressed the anti-HIgG antibody response by more than 95% for over 300 days after a series of seven injections of the immunizing antigen in mice [21] ', ' While the exact mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs remains unknown, adoptive transfer of splenocytes from animals given several doses of PEGylated compounds to naïve animals suggests that PEG-modified allergens activate antigen-specific CD8 + suppressor T cells [15, 18, 27, 28] ', ' Since proliferation of suppressor T cells and the associated production of factors that dampen the immune response is dependent upon the concentration of circulating antigen during the tolerization process, slowing of antigen processing and extending the half-life of the antigen by PEGylation most likely plays a major role in the immunosuppressive capacity of the conjugates [17,24,25]', 'As data continued to suggest that PEGylated biomolecules were less immunogenic than their native counterparts, many interested in preventing immunorejection during transplantation began to apply this process to intact, viable cells and tissues', ' Modification of type A and type B human red blood cells (RBCs) with mPEG did not compromise the structure, function and viability of the cell and prevented agglutination by anti-A and anti-B antisera, respectively [29-31]', ' PEGylation of ovine RBCs prolonged their survival when transfused into mice [30] ', ' PEGylation of lymphocytes can inhibit MHC class II activation and proliferation of T cells, as was demonstrated in an in vivo model of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease [31] [32] [33] ', ' Adoptive transfer of PEGylated splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice to lethally irradiated Balb/c mice extended survival time from 7 to 10 days [34]', ' PEGylation reduced proliferation in the donor T cell population, suggesting that the loss of T cell responsiveness is likely due to disruption interactions between the T cells and antigen presenting cells necessary to mount an immune response [32] ', ' It has also been suggested that this weak, ineffective co-stimulation of alloreactive T cells induces apoptosis, leading to tolerance of donor tissue [34] ', ' This phenomenon has been further exemplified in diabetic rat models where PEGylation improved pancreatic islet viability, facilitated engraftment and re-established blood glucose homeostasis [34, 35] ', ' Additional studies demonstrated that PEGylation efficiently blocked recognition of the transplants by immune cells, allowing them to remain stably functional in diabetic recipients for several weeks [35-38]', 'Approval of Adagen\\uf0d2 (Pegademase) for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) by the U', 'S', ' FDA in the early 1990s illustrated the potential for PEGylation to significantly impact modern therapeutics', ' The half-life of this product, bovine adenosine deaminase randomly modified with 5 kDa PEG molecules, increased from less than 30 min to 28 hr for the conjugated counterpart [39] ', ' This, along with the fact that the modified enzyme preparation could evoke 1,800 times the activity per milliliter of red blood cells alone [40] , marked notable progress in the area of enzyme replacement therapy by minimizing the number of doses needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, eliminating the need for blood transfusion and avoiding the risk of iron overload and transfusion-associated viral infection [11] ', ' In a similar manner, therapeutic use of L-asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was hindered by the fact that frequent intramuscular injections, necessary for therapeutic efficacy, also induced strong hypersensitivity reactions, rendering the enzyme ineffective in many patients [41] ', ' Covalent attachment of 5 kDa PEG to this enzyme four years later reduced its immunogenicity and the necessity for frequent dosing, allowing for successful use in those with hypersensitivity to the unmodified enzyme [42] [43] [44] ', ' Within the last 10 years, improvements in polymer homogeneity and PEGylation chemistry have produced many potent, wellcharacterized, protein-based therapeutics', ' Therapeutic PEGylated proteins currently marketed in the United States and Europe are summarized in Table 1 ', ' Two marketed products of PEGylated interferon alpha (IFN-\\uf0b5), PEGIntron (Schering Plough) and PEGASYS (Roche), illustrate how different PEG chemistries can affect the pharmacokinetic profile of a biologically active protein', ' PEGIntron (IFN-\\uf0b52b) contains a single chain 12kDa PEG attached to His34 via a urethane bond [45] ', ' Although this modification significantly extends the elimination halflife and reduces the clearance of the protein (Table 2) , the conjugate is hydrolytically unstable in plasma and when stored at ambient temperatures [46] ', ' The activity of this preparation relative to the unmodified protein is 28% [47] ', ' In contrast, PEGASYS (IFN\\uf0b5-2a) contains branched 40 kDa PEG molecules attached to lysine residues via an amide bond [48] ', ' This conjugate, with greater in vitro and in vivo stability has a significantly longer half life than PEGIntron and reduces the clearance of the protein by a factor of 100, overshadowing the fact that the modified protein retains only 7% of the relative activity of the unmodified protein (Table 2 ) [47] ', ' Despite their differences, both products have greater anti-viral action than their native counterparts, reducing administration schedules from three times a week to once weekly [49, 50] ', ' Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and an anti-TNF-\\uf0b5 Fab\\uf0a2 have been conjugated to PEG in order to increase the overall size of the molecule', ' In the case of Pegfilgrastim (Neublasta\\uf0d2:PEGylated G-CSF), the increase in size minimizes renal clearance of the drug, prolongs the circulation time and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils which, in turn, aid in clearing the compound once therapeutic levels are attained [51] ', ' Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia\\uf0d2), the Fab\\uf0a2 fragment of a humanized anti-tumor necrosis factor-\\uf061 (TNF\\uf061) monoclonal antibody linked to a branched 40 kDa PEG maleimide at a single cysteine residue, demonstrates a prolonged circulating time in blood, such that a single monthly subcutaneous injection is sufficient for therapeutic efficacy', ' In addition, increasing the size of this molecule by PEGylation allows it to preferentially accumulate in inflamed tissue, where its therapeutic effect is primarily needed [46]', 'Gene therapy has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a potential method for diverse applications including the correction of inherited genetic and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as the treatment of cancer, cardiovascular and infectious diseases [52, 53] ', ' Despite encouraging pre-clinical results, practical use of this technology has been hindered by inefficient delivery to specific cellular targets and immune responses to both the vector selected for gene transfer and the transgene product', ' Rapid clearance from the circulation by the complement system and the immunogenicity associated with non-viral and viral vectors alike were the primary reasons for applying PEGylation technology to gene delivery vectors', ' In this regard, PEGylation was initially used for non-viral vectors and eventually for viral vectors as the immune response became the most significant limitation to therapeutic gene transfer', ' Additional efforts soon recognized that advanced PEG chemistries accommodated attachment of specific ligands to the vectors, making them less promiscuous and promoting tissue and cell-specific gene expression', 'Non-viral gene transfer is a method by which DNA is formulated with cationic lipids and/or polymers to create dense particles that are delivered to target cells by physical means such as direct injection, electroporation or gene gun [54] ', ' These particles, however, are often rapidly sequestered in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and are removed from the bloodstream within minutes after systemic administration [55, 56] ', ' PEGylation was primarily used to reduce the rate at which these vectors are cleared to improve therapeutic efficacy', ' This has been achieved by PEGylating preparations containing branched polyethylenenimine/\\uf062-cyclodextrin/DNA polyplexes as well as simple DNA/chitosan mixtures [57] [58] [59] ', ' In both cases, this modification minimized aggregate formation under physiological conditions and prolonged circulation time, thereby reducing uptake by macrophages and improving overall transduction efficiency of each system', ' Numerous reports have shown that PEGylation also reduces binding of DNA complexes to plasma proteins and minimizes toxicity while improving the stability, solubility and, in turn, transfection efficiency of these non-viral preparations [52, 57, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] ', ' Results from these studies and data accumulated from clinical trials with viral vectors soon prompted development of PEGylation strategies for viruses', 'Although viral vectors, unlike their non-viral counterparts, are extremely efficient at inducing transgene expression in cellular targets, their clinical utility is hindered by significant immunogenicity and toxicity', ' Covalent modification of proteins contained in the virus coat with PEG has been shown to improve both the physicochemical and biological properties of several recombinant viruses used for gene transfer (Table 3) including adeno-associated virus (AAV) [66, 67] , pseudotyped lentivirus [68] , retrovirus [69, 70] , and baculovirus [71] ', 'PEGylation has also been used to modify influenza virosomes, virus-like particles synthesized from capsid proteins, to minimize host immunological responses [72, 73] ', ' While results with many viral vectors have been minimal, there has been a significant effort in developing PEGylation protocols for one of the most potent vectors with a highly characterized toxicity profile to date, the adenovirus', ' Table 3 ', ' Current Summary of PEGylated Viruses and the Reported Impact of Modification', 'Model Biological effects Ref', 'Conjugation of AAV with monomethoxy poly(ethylene) glycols activated by tresyl chloride (TMPEG) and succinimidyl succinate (SSPEG) chemistries did not compromise transduction efficiency', 'PEGylation with either 2 kDa or 5 kDa PEG at 1:1, 10:1, 100:1 and 1000:1 PEG:lysine ratios did not compromise transduction efficiency', ' Conjugation of rAAV with 2 kDa PEG at the 1000:1 PEG lysine ratio protected from serum neutralization', 'in vivo SSPEG and TMPEG improved gene transduction in the lung without compromising transduction efficiency in the liver and muscle', ' TMPEG reduced Th1-type response', ' Successful readministration of virus after iv injection was achieved by modification with TMPEG', ' Table 3 ']\n"
