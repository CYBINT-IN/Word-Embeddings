The reproduction numbers, R j , are estimated for different epidemics from the selected growth models. The regression coefficient, β, is to be estimated. Hence, the term (e β -1)*100% is the percentage change rate (of R), which can be interpreted as the percentage change in transmissibility due to a one unit (mm) increase in monthly rainfall. The framework of the regression is based on the exponential form of the predictor to model the expectation of transmissibility (e.g., R); this framework is inspired by previous work [28] [29] [30] [31] .

Out of four outbreaks in the states of Bauchi and Plateau, there are three estimated τs after EW 10 ( Table 1) , and this state also has the largest number of LF cases in the outbreaks of both 2017-18 (41.9% of all cases) and 2018-19 (36.0% of all cases). Hypothesized spatial heterogeneity in the R is tested by Cochran's Q test. The testing results for the Rs in the five states are significant (i.e., p-value < 0.05) for both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 LF epidemics. Thus, we report the existence of spatial heterogeneity in LF epidemics in Nigeria.\",\n",

The R t is a series of time-dependent reproduction numbers, namely, timedependent effective reproduction numbers, which can be estimated by a renewable equation [20, 22, 23, 33, 34] . The factors that affect the changing dynamics of R t, include (i) the depletion of the susceptible population [28], (ii) the change (usually it is the improvement) in the unmeasurable disease control efforts (e.g., contract tracing) and local awareness of the outbreak [29], and (iii) the natural features of the pathogen (e.g., its original infectivity and other interepidemic factors) [28, 29, 31]. The estimated R in this work is a point estimate to summarize LASV transmissibility over a whole epidemic. Hence, the temporal changes of the susceptible population in (i), above, and local disease awareness and control related to (ii) do not affect R.

We report the most significant (i.e., with the lowest p-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e., rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [6] . The range of lag from 4-9 months has previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the rodent population [7] . The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [6-10]. This relation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data in the Nigerian regions included in this work. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF outbreaks suggests that knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policy-makers trying to achieve LF prevention and control.',\n",

       " 'Lassa fever (LF), caused by Lassa virus (LASV), is increasingly recognized as an important rodent-borne viral hemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to some of the communities in sub-Saharan West Africa [1] . Discovered in 1969 [2], LF is endemic to much of rural Nigeria and regions in the Mano River Union [3] . LASV transmits from human to human, as well as via the zoonotic cycle [1, 3, 4] . LF has a high case fatality rate ranging from 1% in the community to over 60% in hospital settings [1, 4, 5] . The common reservoir of LASV is Mastomys natalensis, one of the most widespread rodent species in sub-Saharan Africa [1, 3] , which exhibit sensitive population dynamics to water level [6, 7] . Previous studies have recognized the ecological connection between the population levels of rodents and rainfall [8] [9] [10] .LF epidemics typically start in November and last until May of the following year, with the majority of cases occurring in the first quarter of the following year, in addition to sporadic cases reported throughout the year. The 2017-18 epidemic in Nigeria was an unprecedented LF outbreak in the country\\'s history [11] , which resulted in 400 confirmed cases, including 97 deaths, between January and March 2018 [12] . The 2018-19 epidemic in Nigeria has already caused 420 confirmed cases from January to March 02 of 2019, which included 93 deaths [12] . The five states of Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi, and Plateau are the only states that have been among the top 10 hit hardest states in terms of number of LF cases in both the 2018 (85.5% of total national cases) and 2019 (85.7% of total national cases) outbreaks. While there have been discussions about the connection of rainfall to LF [13, 14] , this connection has not yet been demonstrated and quantified. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of outbreaks in different Nigerian regions between January 2016 and March 2019. We estimate LF infectivity in terms of the reproduction number (R) and quantify the association between R and local rainfall by using modeling analysis. We explore the spatial heterogeneity of the LF outbreaks and summarize the overall findings with model-average estimates.Weekly Lassa fever (LF) surveillance data are obtained from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) [12] . Laboratory-confirmed case time series are used for analysis. We examine the major epidemics that occurred between January 2016 and March 2019 across the whole country and only in the five states that were among the top 10 hardest-hit states in both the 2018 and 2019 outbreaks, i.e., Edo, Ondo, Ebonyi, Bauchi, and Plateau. Local rainfall records are collected from the historical records of the World Weather Online website [15] . Four different nonlinear growth models are adopted to pinpoint the epidemiological features of each outbreak. The models are the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz, and Weibull growth models. These simple structured models are widely used to study S-shaped cumulative growth processes; e.g., the curve of a single-wave epidemic and have been extensively studied in previous work [16, 17] . These models consider cumulative cases with saturation in the growth rate to reflect the progression of an epidemic due to reductions in susceptible pools. The extrinsic growth rate does not steadily decline but increases to a maximum (i.e., saturation) before steadily declining to zero.We fit all models to the weekly reported LF cases in different regions evaluate the fitting performance by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). We adopt the standard nonlinear least squares (NLS) approach for model fitting and parameter estimation, following [16, 18] . A pvalue < 0.05 is regarded as statistically significant, and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are estimated for all unknown parameters. The models are selected by comparing the AIC to that of the baseline model. Only the models with an AIC lower than the AIC of the baseline model are considered for further analysis. Since the epidemic curves of an infectious disease commonly exhibit autocorrelations [19], we use autoregression (AR) models with a degree of 2, i.e., AR(2), as the baseline models for growth model selection. We also adopt the coefficient of determination (R-squared) and the coefficient of partial determination (partial R-squared) to evaluate goodness-of-fit and fitting improvement, respectively. For partial Rsquared, the AR(2) model is treated as the baseline model.After the selection of models, we estimate the epidemiological features (parameters) of turning point (τ) and reproduction number (R) from the selected models. The turning point is defined as the time point of a sign change in the rate of case accumulation, i.e., from increasing to decreasing or vice versa [16, 18] . The reproduction number, R, is the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by one infectious case during a disease outbreak [18, 20] . When the population is totally (i.e., 100%) susceptible, the R will equate to the basic reproduction number, commonly denoted as R 0 [20, 21] . The reproduction number (R) is given in Eqn (1),.

The serial interval (i.e., the generation interval) is the time between successive cases in a chain of transmission [20, 22, 23] . The function h(•) represents the probability distribution of κ. Hence, the function M(•) is the Laplace transform of h(•), and specifically, M(•) is the moment generating function (MGF) of a probability distribution [20] . According to previous work [24], we assume h(κ) to follow a Gamma distribution with a mean of 7.8 days and a standard deviation (SD) of 10.7 days. Therefore, R can be estimated with the values of γ from the fitted models [18, 20, 25].We then summarize the κ and R estimates by AIC-weighted model averaging. The AIC weights, w, of the selected models (with AIC lower than the AIC from the AR(2) model) are defined in Eqn (2),Here, AIC i is the AIC of the i-th selected model, and the AIC min is the lowest AIC among all selected models. Thus, the i-th selected model has a weight of w i . The model-averaged estimator is the weighted average of the estimates in each selected model, which has been well studied in previous work [16, 26] .Testing the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics After finding the model-averaged estimates, we apply Cochran\\'s Q test to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the epidemics in different regions over the same period of time [27] . For instance, we treat the model-averaged R estimates as the univariate meta-analytical response against different Nigerian regions (states) and further check the heterogeneity by estimating the significance levels of the Q statistics. A p-value < 0.05 is regarded as statistically significant.The association between local rainfall and LASV transmissibility are modeled by a linear random-effect regression (LRER) model in Eqn (3),Here, E(•) represents the expectation function and j is the region index corresponding to different regions (states). Term c j is the interception term of the j-th region to be estimated and it is variable from different regions, serving as the baseline scale of transmissibility in different states. The term t denotes the cumulative lag in the model, and 〈rainfall j,t 〉 represents the average monthly rainfall of the previous t months from the turning point, τ, of the j-th region. The reproduction numbers, R j , are estimated for different epidemics from the selected growth models. The regression coefficient, β, is to be estimated. Hence, the term (e β -1)*100% is the percentage change rate (of R), which can be interpreted as the percentage change in transmissibility due to a one unit (mm) increase in monthly rainfall. The framework of the regression is based on the exponential form of the predictor to model the expectation of transmissibility (e.g., R); this framework is inspired by previous work [28] [29] [30] [31] . To quantify the impacts of local rainfall, we calculate the percentage change rate with different cumulative lags (t) from 0-11 months and estimate their significant levels. Only the lag terms (t) with significant estimates are presented in this work. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/602706 doi: bioRxiv preprintWe present the modeling analysis procedures in a flow diagram in Figure 2 . All analyses are conducted by using R (version 3.4.3 [32]), and the R function \"nls\" is employed for the NLS estimation of model parameters.The rainfall time series of the five states and the weekly reported LF cases of the whole of Nigeria are shown in Figure 1 (a)-(b). We observe that the major LF epidemics usually occur in Nigeria between November and May of the following year. The cumulative lagged effects can be observed by matching the peak timing of the rainfall and epidemic curves. In Figure  1 (c), we shift the rainfall time series of the five states by +6.5 months to match the trends of the national LF epidemic curve in Nigeria. To further test the credibility of this match, we use a simple statistical regression model of \"case ~ α exp(β * rainfall) + θ\", where α, β and θ are free parameters to be estimated, to check the outcome of the least-square fit. In Figure 1 (d)-(e), we find that the fit has a p-value less than 0.0001, which indicates a significant (statistical) association between the LF cases and shifted rainfall curve.We fit four different growth models to the LF confirmed cases and estimate the modelaverage reproduction number (R) after model selection. We show the growth model fitting results in Figure 3 and the model estimation and selection results in Table 1 . The models fit the epidemic data well, and most of them have AICs lower than the baseline AR(2) model. Most of the regions exhibit an epidemic turning point (τ) ranging from epidemiological week (EW) 4 to 10 in each year. Out of four outbreaks in the states of Bauchi and Plateau, there are three estimated τs after EW 10 ( Table 1) , and this state also has the largest number of LF cases in the outbreaks of both 2017-18 (41.9% of all cases) and 2018-19 (36.0% of all cases). Hypothesized spatial heterogeneity in the R is tested by Cochran\\'s Q test. The testing results for the Rs in the five states are significant (i.e., p-value < 0.05) for both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 LF epidemics. Thus, we report the existence of spatial heterogeneity in LF epidemics in Nigeria.We choose to use the average reproduction number (R) rather than the instantaneous reproduction number, commonly denoted by R t [22, 23] , as the measurement of the LASV transmissibility. The R t is a series of time-dependent reproduction numbers, namely, timedependent effective reproduction numbers, which can be estimated by a renewable equation [20, 22, 23, 33, 34] . The factors that affect the changing dynamics of R t, include (i) the depletion of the susceptible population [28], (ii) the change (usually it is the improvement) in the unmeasurable disease control efforts (e.g., contract tracing) and local awareness of the outbreak [29], and (iii) the natural features of the pathogen (e.g., its original infectivity and other interepidemic factors) [28, 29, 31]. The estimated R in this work is a point estimate to summarize LASV transmissibility over a whole epidemic. Hence, the temporal changes of the susceptible population in (i), above, and local disease awareness and control related to (ii) do not affect R. With respect to point (iii) and other heterogeneities of outbreaks in different . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

These dummy variables serve as random effects to offset regional heterogeneities in LF epidemics. Therefore, we can then quantify a consistent effect (the β in Eqn (3)) of the lagged rainfall on the LASV R estimate.The association between local rainfall and LASV transmissibility (R) are modeled and quantified by the LRER model. In Figure 4 , we find a positive relation between rainfall and R. The estimated change rate in R for a one unit (mm) increase in rainfall is summarized with different cumulative lag terms (the t in Eqn (3)).\\uf0b7 p-value: 0.044) with a regression R-squared of 0.36. We report the most significant (i.e., with the lowest p-value) regression estimates that appear with a cumulative lag of 7 months. The habitats of the LASV reservoir, i.e., rodents, include irrigated and flooded agricultural lands that are commonly found in and around African villages [6] . The range of lag from 4-9 months has previously been explained by the time interval between the peak of the rainfall and the rodent population [7] . The association between rodent population dynamics and rainfall levels has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies [6-10]. This relation could also be verified by examining the rodent population data in the Nigerian regions included in this work. The present finding of the impact of lagged rainfall on LF outbreaks suggests that knowledge of such weather-driven epidemics could be gained by referring to past rainfall levels. For instance, if a relatively high amount of rainfall occurs, local measures, such as rodent population control, could be effective to reduce the LF risk. The findings in this work are of public health interest and are helpful for policy-makers trying to achieve LF prevention and control.On the one hand, our findings suggest the existence of an association between rainfall and LASV transmissibility, which could be affected by the population dynamics of rodents [13] . On the other hand, the positive relation between rainfall and R indicates that rainfall, particularly in states with a high LF risk, can be used as a warning signal for LF epidemics. The modeling framework in this study can be easily extended to other infectious diseases. Table 1 . The summary table of the model estimations. Population numbers are summarized in units of one million. The \"improvement\" is the goodness-of-fit estimate, i.e., the partial Rsquared, from the baseline AR(2) model. The \"weight\" is the AIC-weight of the selected model, which is used for calculating the model-averaged estimates. The \"NA\" means a summary term that is not applicable to a certain model. The notation \"-\" means that the model cannot achieve a converging fitting outcome. The model-averaged estimates in each region are highlighted in gray.
